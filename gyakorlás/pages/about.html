            "A lightsaber has five main parts. The power cell, the casing, the
            focusing lens, the emitter and, of course, the crystal. The rest is
            just wiring, an on/off switch, and whatever fancy extra bits people
            want to build in. All in all though, it's a pretty simple device."

            A lightsaber drew power from an appropriately-sized power cell.
            Parts that would work to make a lightsaber include modulation
            circuits and an energy gate. Ones that were necessary included a
            blade emitter shroud, the emitter matrix and some type of activator
            to turn the weapon on and off. Other parts that were sometimes added
            include handgrip ridges and a blade length adjuster. Some
            lightsabers also featured a non-lethal low-power setting used for
            training. Single-bladed lightsabers usually had a belt ring so they
            could be hung from a belt hook, or a wheel-shaped attachment that
            slotted into a matching belt clip on the owner's belt when not in
            use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specially designed lightsabers could even use unstable crystals,
            such as Kylo Ren's lightsaber, which featured two laterally facing
            vents designed to divert excess energy away from the cracked crystal
            and keep the lightsaber stable. This also had the effect of creating
            a protective crossguard.
          </p>
          <p>
            During assembly, it was important to not accidentally invert the
            emitter matrix; when activated the lightsabers' power grid would
            backfire. At best this could cause the blade to quickly short out,
            but if it was left on, the faulty weapon would violently explode,
            potentially killing those in close proximity.
