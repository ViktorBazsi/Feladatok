        The sheer number of Jedi active during the days of the Galactic Republic
        naturally resulted in countless variations in the designs of
        lightsabers. Some of these modifications were merely for the exterior
        looks of the saber, while others enhanced the sabers functionality in
        unique ways. While the traditional single bladed lightsaber was the
        design most Jedi used, some preferred creative adaptation of this
        classic weapon.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Sith lightsaber—The lightsabers wielded by members of the Sith. The
          designs of Sith lightsabers depended on the user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Double-bladed lightsaber—Double-bladed lightsabers consisted of a hilt
          that projected a blade from both ends, resulting in a deadly
          staff-like weapon.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Hinged double-bladed lightsaber—Was a type of double-bladed
              lightsaber that could fold in half, making it easier to store
              while not in use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Double-bladed spinning lightsaber—A double-bladed spinning
              lightsaber projected a blade from each end of the hilt. However,
              the hilt was as long as a single-bladed lightsaber, with a
              circular rim that, when activated, could spin the blades along a
              track. This variant was used by the Inquisitorius.
            </li>
            <li>
              Split saber—A split saber consisted of two separate lightsabers
              that join together forming a double-bladed lightsaber.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lightsaber pike—Featuring two yellow plasma blades on each side of
              the staff, lightsaber pikes were used by the Jedi Temple Guard.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Dual-phase lightsaber—A dual-phase lightsaber contained one or
          multiple focusing crystals, which allowed its blade length to be
          extended or shortened in the middle of combat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Broadsaber—A lightsaber with a broad flat blade that resembled a
          traditional sword.
        </li>
        <li>
          Curved-hilt lightsaber—Curved-hilt lightsabers were of a design which
          featured a hilt with a built in curve. This was usually done to allow
          the hilt to fit better into the palm, facilitating the use of
          one-handed fighting styles such as Form II.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightwhip—A lightwhip had a flexible blade that was several meters
          long, and could entangle opponents.
        </li>
      </ul>

        There also existed a type of blaster known as a lightsaber rifle which
        was designed to be combined with a lightsaber. To work, the user would
        insert a standard lightsaber into a slot on top of the rifle. Once
        loaded, the weapon could fire powerful beams of energy that were highly
        destructive. Additionally both Jedi Masters Ki-Adi-Mundi and Agen
        Kolar both owned a lightsaber that had two different colored kyber
        crystals, allowing it to change colors from green to blue.
