            The <b>lightsaber</b>, also referred to as a <b>laser sword</b> by
            those who were unfamiliar with it, was a weapon usually used by the
            Jedi, Sith, and other Force-sensitives. Lightsabers consisted of a
            <i>plasma blade</i>, powered by a <i>kyber crystal</i>, that was
            emitted from a usually <i>metal hilt</i> and could be shut off at
            will. It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was
            greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with the Force. Though
            also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi,
            with some in the galaxy believing only Jedi could use lightsabers.

            Lightsabers were generally used for both offense and defense. A
            lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from flesh to blast
            doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber
            was with a weapon made with material that conducted energy, such as
            an electrostaff, a Z6 riot control baton, some rare metals like
            beskar, or another lightsaber. When used defensively, a
            Force-sensitive could deflect blaster bolts with a lightsaber, and
            with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or
            some other target. Experienced Jedi could even employ their
            lightsabers to absorb Force lightning. Most practitioners used one
            single-bladed lightsaber, though some used double-bladed lightsabers
            or even multiple lightsabers at once. A popular example to using
            multiple lightsabers is Grievous.
