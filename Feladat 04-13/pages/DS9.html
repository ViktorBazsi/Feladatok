        Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9) is an American science fiction
        television series created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller. The fourth
        series in the Star Trek media franchise, it originally aired in
        syndication from January 3, 1993, to June 2, 1999, spanning 176 episodes
        over seven seasons.[2] Set in the 24th century, when Earth is part of a
        United Federation of Planets, its narrative is centered on the eponymous
        space station Deep Space Nine, located adjacent to a wormhole connecting
        Federation territory to the Gamma Quadrant on the far side of the Milky
        Way galaxy.

        Following the success of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Paramount
        Pictures commissioned a new series set in the Star Trek fictional
        universe. In creating Deep Space Nine, Berman and Piller drew upon plot
        elements introduced in The Next Generation, namely the conflict between
        two species, the Cardassians and the Bajorans. Deep Space Nine was the
        first Star Trek series to be created without the direct involvement of
        franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, the first set on a space station
        rather than a traveling starship and the first to have an African
        American as its central character: Starfleet Commander, later Captain,
        Benjamin Sisko (played by Avery Brooks).

        Changes were made to the series over the course of its seven-year run.
        In the third season, the starship USS Defiant was introduced to enable
        more stories away from the space station, and the fourth added Worf
        (Michael Dorn), a character who originated on The Next Generation, to
        the main cast. The final three seasons deal with a story arc, that of
        the war between the Federation and an invading Gamma Quadrant power, the
        Dominion. Although not as popular as The Next Generation, Deep Space
        Nine was critically well received. Following the success of Deep Space
        Nine, Paramount commissioned Berman, Piller and Jeri Taylor to produce
        Star Trek: Voyager, which began in 1995. During Deep Space Nine's run,
        various episode novelizations and tie-in video games were produced.
        After the show ended, various novels and comics continued the adventures
        of the crew.
