            Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) is an American science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry. 
            It originally aired from September 28, 1987, to May 23, 1994, in syndication, spanning 178 episodes over seven seasons. 
            The third series in the Star Trek franchise, it was inspired by Star Trek: The Original Series. 
            Set in the latter third of the 24th century, when Earth is part of the United Federation of Planets, 
            it follows the adventures of a Starfleet starship, the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D), in its exploration of the Alpha quadrant 
            and Beta quadrant in the Milky Way galaxy.

            In the 1980s, Roddenberry—who was responsible for the original Star Trek, Star Trek: The Animated Series (1973–1974), 
            and the first of a series of films—was tasked by Paramount Pictures with creating a new series in the franchise. 
            He decided to set it a century after the events of his original series. The Next Generation featured a new crew: Patrick Stewart 
            as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes as William Riker, Brent Spiner as Data, Michael Dorn as Worf, LeVar Burton 
            as Geordi La Forge, Marina Sirtis as Deanna Troi, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar, 
            Wil Wheaton as Wesley Crusher, and a new Enterprise.

            Roddenberry, Maurice Hurley, Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor served as executive producers at various times 
            throughout its production. The series was broadcast in first-run syndication with dates and times varying among 
            individual television stations. Stewart's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated 
            the starship's purpose:
        </p>

                Space: The final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: 
                to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.

            The show was very popular, reaching almost 12 million viewers in its 5th season, with the series finale in 1994 watched 
            by over 30 million viewers.[3][4] Due to its success, Paramount commissioned Rick Berman and Michael Piller to create 
            a fourth series in the franchise, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, which launched in 1993. The characters from The Next Generation 
            returned in four films: Star Trek Generations (1994), Star Trek: First Contact (1996), Star Trek: Insurrection (1998), 
            and Star Trek: Nemesis (2002), and in the television series Star Trek: Picard (2020–2023). The series is also 
            the setting of numerous novels, comic books, and video games. It received many accolades, including 19 Emmy Awards, 
            two Hugo Awards, one Peabody Award, and six Saturn Awards, including a Lifetime Achievement Award 
            for the entire cast in 2024.[5][a]
