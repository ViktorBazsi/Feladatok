        Red Rising is a 2014 dystopian science fiction novel by American author
        Pierce Brown, and the first book and eponym of a series. The novel, set
        in the future on Mars, follows lowborn miner Darrow as he infiltrates
        the ranks of the elite Golds.
      </p>
      <p>Red Rising has received generally positive reviews.</p>

      <hr />
      <p>
        It has been seven hundred years since mankind colonized other planets.
        The powerful ruling class of humans has installed a rigid, color-based
        social hierarchy where the physically superior Golds at the top rule
        with an iron fist. Sixteen-year-old Darrow is a Red, a class of workers
        who toil beneath the surface of Mars mining helium-3 to terraform the
        planet. He and his wife Eo are captured after entering a forbidden area
        and are arrested. While Eo is publicly whipped for her crime she sings a
        forbidden folk song as a protest against the Reds' enslavement. She is
        subsequently hanged on the orders of the Mars' ArchGovernor. Darrow cuts
        down and buries his wife's body, a crime for which he is also hanged.
        However, Darrow awakes to find that he has been drugged and delivered
        into the hands of the Sons of Ares, a group of Red and others who fight
        against the oppression of the "low Colors". The Sons have adopted the
        video of Eo's song and execution as a rallying vehicle for their cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        Darrow is given the chance to infiltrate the Society to bring it down
        from within. He is physically transformed by Mickey, a Violet "carver",
        who gives him the abilities and appearance of a Gold. Using a fabricated
        identity Darrow is accepted into the Golds' elite Institute, where he
        befriends Cassius au Bellona and alienates the arrogant Antonia au
        Severus. Darrow is selected for House Mars by Fitchner. To continue to
        the next stage, Darrow must complete the Passage, a test in which the
        100 newly chosen students in each of the twelve Houses are paired with
        another house member and tasked to kill each other as a means to
        eliminate the weaker half. Darrow is forced to murder Cassius' brother
        Julian to survive, but Cassius can only guess who killed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each House is assigned a fortress and a banner, called a standard, to
        defend within the Institute's confines, with the goal of warring with
        each other until one House enslaves the others by using the standard.
        Mars fractures into factions: one led jointly by Darrow and Cassius, one
        by Antonia, one by Titus au Ladros, and the antisocial Sevro going off
        on his own. To neutralize the violent Titus, who has been raping the
        female slaves left in Mars' fortress, Darrow manipulates House Minerva,
        led by the young woman he met briefly upon his arrival at the Institute
        and whom he has dubbed "Mustang." Mustang and her troops take the Mars
        fortress and imprison Titus. Sevro helps Darrow escape and capture
        Minerva's standard, which he trades to reclaim Mars' castle. Darrow
        takes over as the Primus (leader) of House Mars, and Sevro and his group
        of "Howlers" declare their loyalty to him. Darrow realizes from the
        captive Titus' manner of speech that he is a fellow Red, also
        impersonating a Gold, like him. To maintain his cover, Darrow allows
        Titus to be executed by Cassius. Darrow captures Minerva's fortress and
        defeats their strongman Pax au Telemanus. Mustang reveals the existence
        of "the Jackal", the leader of House Pluto who is terrorizing other
        Houses. Lilath, a messenger from the Jackal, arrives to deliver a
        message; the Jackal has put a bounty on Darrow’s head. Antonia and some
        of Titus' former followers attempt to ambush and kill Darrow, but he
        manages to thwart their plan. Lilath secretly reveals to Cassius that
        Darrow killed Julian. Cassius lures and challenges Darrow to a duel
        outside Mars' fortress, wounding him and leaving him to die.
      </p>
      <p>
        Darrow is rescued and nursed back to health by Mustang. They begin to
        develop romantic feelings for each other as they flee to avoid discovery
        by Cassius, now Primus of House Mars. Conquered students are
        systematically "enslaved" by other Houses, forced by their honor to
        serve their conquerors. Darrow and Mustang begin to amass an army by
        recruiting many Oathbreakers, the wandering slaves who have chosen to
        disobey orders, with Minerva's standard. Darrow prefers that his
        captured foes swear their allegiance and join him, rather than serve
        him. Learning from his previous mistakes, he frees these slaves and
        takes responsibility for their actions to gain their allegiance. He
        gains the loyalty of the duplicitous Tactus au Rath when he accepts
        physical punishment on himself after administering the same to Tactus
        for unruly behavior. Sevro, who has led his team of Howlers to escape
        from Cassius and has now lost an eye, meets up with Darrow again to join
        forces. Darrow takes the fortresses of Houses Ceres, Apollo, and
        Jupiter, enslaving their members until the prisoners prove their loyalty
        to him in battle. Fitchner reveals to Darrow that the other Proctors
        have been conspiring to assist the Jackal, who is actually Adrius, the
        son of ArchGovernor Augustus. Darrow exposes a prisoner taken during the
        surrender of house Jupiter as the Jackal after impaling his hand and
        offering him the opportunity to free himself by cutting it off. The
        Jackal slices off his own hand to escape and uses Darrow's shock as an
        opening, attacking him and killing Pax in the attempt; then escaping
        with the assistance of Proctor Apollo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enraged by the Proctors' deliberate efforts to hinder his victory,
        Darrow slays Proctor Apollo, and his army storms Mount Olympus, the
        floating palace of the Proctors, using the flying boots gained from
        Proctor Apollo. With the remaining Proctors subdued with the help of
        Sevro and the Howlers, Darrow sends Mustang to capture the Jackal, only
        to find out from Fitchner that she is Virginia au Augustus, the Jackal's
        twin sister. Darrow expects a betrayal, but she returns to deliver her
        captive brother, and Darrow wins the exercise. Before he departs,
        Cassius promises Darrow revenge. With his victory, Darrow is given his
        choice of a patron to sponsor his future. He accepts the hated
        ArchGovernor Augustus' offer to serve as one of his lancers, knowing
        that the powerful man will offer him the greatest opportunities to
        acquire the power he needs to destroy the Golds.

        Brown said of writing Red Rising, "I started with the main character
        [Darrow] and shaped my world around him. I was inspired by the plight of
        Irish immigrants in the 19th century and by the disenfranchisement of
        working classes."[1] Brown also explained:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        Pax's death was capricious and bothered me. I needed the Jackal to
        demonstrate his nature in Book 1 so I put all the names in the hat
        except Darrow and Mustang. When I pulled out Pax's name I stood there
        thinking, "I could just put it back in, no-one would ever know." I had a
        huge story arc planned with Darrow being with the Telemanuses against
        the Bellonas and that changed everything. But it was better, ultimately,
        that Darrow didn't have that shelter to hide behind.[2]

        Red Rising was well received by both readers and critics, and hit #20 on
        The New York Times Best Seller list in February 2014.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
        Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly gave the book an A−, writing,
        "Brown writes with cinematic grandeur, cleverly fusing Roman mythology
        with science fiction and pacing his action scenes for a slow-burn build
        to a hold-your-breath final act."[4] Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the
        book 3.5 out of 4 stars, proclaiming, "Red Rising ascends above a
        crowded dystopian field."[5] Writing for The Huffington Post, Britt
        Michaelian explained, "The morals and values that are explored through
        the characters in Red Rising have the potential to inspire a generation
        of readers to think intelligently about the impact of their decisions on
        themselves, their family and friends and on their world as a whole. This
        book is truly a powerful lesson in leadership."[6] Niall Alexander wrote
        for Tor.com:
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        On the surface, Red Rising resembles any number of other genre novels of
        note, but dig a little deeper ... to reveal real uniqueness: in Brown’s
        nearly seamless assemblage of several time-tested traditions, if not in
        a great many of his debut’s myriad threads independently ... Its final
        act ... is like a heart attack: a no-holds-barred bastard of a finale in
        which the author gathers a spread of elements together in much the same
        way George R. R. Martin’s does in the best and most brutal bits of his
        bestselling saga ... For once I would have loved more in the way of
        worldbuilding, and Brown could have made the most of a longer novel by
        exploring a few of his fiction’s most interesting figures further, but
        it bears remembering that Red Rising is only the beginning of a
        trilogy—which is to say there’s space and time for this impressive young
        author to work out its biggest kinks.[7]
      </p>
      <p>
        Kirkus Reviews described the novel as "reminiscent of The Hunger Games
        and Game of Thrones", calling it "a fine novel for those who like to
        immerse themselves in alternative worlds".[8] However, Publishers Weekly
        said of the novel, "Pierce offers a Hollywood-ready story with plenty of
        action and thrills but painfully little originality or plausibility."[9]
      </p>
      <p>
        Brown's Red Rising fans have dubbed themselves "Howlers" after
        characters in the novels, and the author has also noted the popularity
        of his novels among outsiders, saying "It's amazing that they have found
        a home in these books ... All these lost souls in my books have
        connected with people and I find it incredibly moving."[2]
